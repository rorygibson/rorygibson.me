                        With more than two decades' experience as a developer, architect, consultant, CTO and founder, I've been around the block a few times in tech.
                        I've worked in the public sector, in agencies, in startups, in gambling, fintech, marketing tech, big data and enterprise software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through my consultancy, Cohesive Technology, I act as a Fractional or Interim CTO, VP Engineering, Technology Advisor, Non-Exec, "consulting CTO", or any number of other non-specific job titles.
                        As much as I love building technology, I believe that the hardest bits are the people problems, and if you fix them then the rest will follow.

                    <p>
                        Many startups don't need to hire a full-time CTO. Getting an experienced one is expensive! Not only that, but many of the CTO's with the chops to help your company scale up are no longer hands-on enough to help you build the thing in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I often engage part-time with startups and scale-ups who want a good combination of strategy and tactics, from someone who's still close enough to the code to be able to tell what works and what doesn't (and why).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bringing me in part-time (what we call being a "fractional CTO", because you get a fraction of me!) gives a good price / performance ratio.

                    </header>
                    <p>I regularly undertake technology-focussed Due Diligence reviews for Venture Capital  and Private Equity houses. These range in scope from quick summaries to multi-day (or multi-week!) deep dives.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes I do this informally for companies who are planning to raise money (or who have made some changes), and want an objective opinion on how well they're doing.</p>
                    <p>If either of these services are of interest, please <a href="mailto:rg@rorygibson.me">email me to talk</a>. References are available upon request.</p>

                    <p>Since about 2002 I've been an advocate of agile and of the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgramming">XP</a> practices. I've always belived in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a> more than I have in commercialised methodologies like Scrum, SAFe and so on. I tend to look at tech and people problems from first principles, and to start by simplifying wherever possible.</p>
                    <p>I believe that teams make software, and that a boss's responsibility is to help, and get the hell out of the way. I try to practice Radical Candor in my management, and if I finish a day feeling that I've been kind, honest and helpful then I'm doing OK.
